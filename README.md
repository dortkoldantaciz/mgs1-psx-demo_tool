Reverse engineering scripts for MGS1


# Usage

Script is VERY WORK IN PROGRESS! I'm still working on figuring out how the RADIO file is layered, and the proper lossless way to pull it.

## Goals

1. Be able to extract all instructions and dialogue
2. Have a readable format by another tool to adjust the dialogue and replace
3. Be able to recreate a 1:1 copy of the RADIO.DAT file when created from the tool 

## Usage

Run it? It's not gonna get very far. Prior / testing versions are in the old version folder.
